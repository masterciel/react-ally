React A11y
==========

Warns about potential accessibility issues with your React elements.

__This is a fork of [`reactjs/react-a11y`][react-a11y], that didn't seem to get
the love it deserves.__

The original repo had a lot of open issues and unmerged pull requests.
Eventually, I would like to see all code merged back into the original!

To see what's changed, look at [Differences from
`react-a11y`](#differences-from-upstream-react-a11y).

## API on this fork

On this fork, the API moves away from the API in the upstream
`reactjs/react-a11y`.  Although the API will be different, transitioning between
API's is made  as smooth as possible because of the deprecation warnings and
building the new defaults on top of the old API.

## Installation

Run:

```sh
npm install romeovs/react-a11y
```

I want to prevent creating a new `npm` package for the fork, to reduce
confusion and ease possible merging of the forks. However, if there is
enough interest, I will probably do it anyway.

## Usage

In your main application file, require the module and call it, you'll start
getting warnings in the console as your app renders.  Note that by default all
rules are turned `off` s oyou need to turn them on first (by setting them to
`"warn"` or `"error"`).

```js
import React    from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

if (ENV === 'development') {
  const a11y = require('react-a11y').default
  a11y(React, ReactDOM, {
    rules: {
      'img-uses-alt': 'warn'
    , 'redundant-alt': [ 'warn', [ 'image', 'photo', 'foto', 'bild' ]]
    // ...
    }
  })
}
```

You probably don't want to call it if you're in production, since it patches the 
React rendering functions and this might make this slower.

## Options

These are the supported configuration options, annotated using [flow][] type
annotations

```js
a11y(React : React, ReactDOM : ReactDOM, opts : object? )
```

`React` is the React object you want to shim to allow the 
accessibility tests.

`ReactDOM` is the ReactDOM object you're using to render the
React components. This is only used on the client side, so you
can safely omit it when using `react-a11y` in node.

### `options`:
  - `plugins : [string]`
    An array of strings corresponding to names of plugins to be used.
    Eg. if the array contains `'aria-wai'` it would include the rules 
    in a (yet to be written) `react-a11y-plugin-aria-wai` module.  You
    are responsible for installing this module.

  - `rules : object`
    The configuration options for each of the rules. This uses the same format
    as [eslint][] does: 
    ```js
    const rules = {
      'img-uses-alt': 'off'
    , 'redundant-alt': [
        'warn'
        // other options to pass to the rule:
      , [
          'foto'
        ]
      ]
    }

    ```
    Refer to the [rule docs](https://github.com/romeovs/react-a11y/tree/master/docs/rules) 
    to see what options are defined for each rule.

  - `reporter : object => undefined`
    Use this to modify how the warnings are displayed.
    The reporter is a function that accepts an object with
    the following keys:
    - `msg : string` - the error message
    - `tagName : string` - the tagName of the violating element (eg. `'img'`)
    - `severity : string` - the severity as configured by the user in the 
      corresponding rule configuration (one of `'off'`, `'warn'`, or `'error'`)
    - `props : object` - the props as passed to the element
    - `displayName : string?` - the `displayName` of the owner, if any
    - `DOMNode : object?` - the violating DOMNode as rendered to the browser
      DOM, this is only available on when `react-a11y` is running in the
      browser.
    - `url : string?` - The url to a webpage explaining why this rule
      is important
    The default reporter displays all the information it can, but listens
    to the deprecated options `includeSrcNode`, `warningPrefix` and
    `throwErro and `throwError`.

  - `filterFn : (string, string, string) => boolean`
    You can filter failures by passing a function to the `filterFn` option. The
    filter function will receive three arguments: the name of the Component
    instance or ReactElement, the id of the violating element, and the failure
    message.

    Note: If it is a ReactElement, the name will be the node type (eg. `div`)

    ```js
    // only show errors on CommentList
    const commentListFailures = function (name, id, msg) {
      return name === "CommentList";
    }

    a11y(React, ReactDOM, { filterFn: commentListFailures });
    ```

## Cleaning Up In Tests

Use the `restoreAll()` method to clean up mutations made to `React`.
Useful if you are using `react-a11y` in your test suite:

```js
beforeEach(() => a11y(React))
afterEach(() => a11y.restoreAll())
```

## Writing plugins

The rules in this version of `react-a11y` are pluggable!
You can write your own plugin to add more rules.  Have a look at 
[writing plugins](https://github.com/romeovs/react-a11y/blob/master/docs/plugins.md<Paste>) in the
docs to get started!

## Differences from upstream [`react-a11y`][react-a11y]

I will try to stay close to the upstream `react-a11y` API,
and document differences here.

  - The API is totally different.  It has a simple plugin system
    so other poeple can write and publish their own rules.  The options have
    become much simpler also.
  - Started using `ReactDOM.finDOMNode` instead of `document.getElementById`, as
    noted in upstream [#54](https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y/issues/54).
    This fixes a lot of issues from upstream:
    - [#54](https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y/issues/54) Use
      React.findDOMNode to log element references
    - [#55](https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y/issues/55) Consider using ref
      to log element references when there is a warning
    - [#77](https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y/issues/77) Breaks pure-render
      checks
    - [#85](https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y/issues/85) Different
      react-a11y ids (server side render)
  - Fixed upstream issue [#102](https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y/issues/102)
    by correctly inferring the component instance.
  - Removed depency on `object.assign`
  - Added some more rules (and will continue to do so), based on the great work
    in [`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`][eslint-plugin] and on the [Google Chrome Audit
    rules][AX].
  - Write a lot more tests.
  - Tests now work both browser-side as client-side with the exception of tests
    that rely on the specific environment.


## TO DO

These are things I need to do in the short run to make the project
usable:

  - [x] add a build-step that mirrors changes in code-style such as
    increased use of ES6 features.
  - [x] add [`eslint`][eslint] config so poeple can collaborate
    more easy.
  - [ ] put up a travis worker to make merging easier.
  - [x] write docs about how to write plugins.
  - [x] ~~normalize props before passing to the rules, eg. change
    `aria-hidden` into `ariaHidden`, so every test can use the
    same method.~~ This makes no sense since React only renders `aria-hidden`.
  - [ ] implement all the rules that are in `facebook/react-a11y` and
    in [`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`][eslint-plugin].
    - [x] `img-uses-alt` (`MISSING_ALT`)
    - [x] `label-uses-for`
    - [x] `mouse-events-map-to-key-events`
    - [x] `no-access-key`
    - [x] `no-hash-ref`
    - [x] `onclick-uses-role` (`NO_ROLE`)
    - [x] `onclick-uses-tabindex` (`NO_TABINDEX`)
    - [x] `redundant-alt`
    - [x] `use-onblur-not-onchange`
    - [x] `valid-aria-role`
    - [x] `button-role-space` (`BUTTON_ROLE_SPACE`)
    - [x] `button-role-enter` (`BUTTON_ROLE_ENTER`)
    - [x] `hidden-uses-tabindex` (`TABINDEX_REQUIRED_WHEN_ARIA_HIDDEN`)
    - [x] ~~`hash-href-needs-button`~~
    - [x] `tabindex-needs-button`
    - [ ] `use-label` (`NO_LABEL`)
    - [x] `no-unsupported-element-uses-aria`
    - [x] `avoid-positive-tabindex`
  - [x] make rule testing machinery available to plugins.
  - [x] allow rule tests to return promises, so they can be asynchronous.
  - [ ] think of a way to lose the `setTimeout` when testing for absence of
        warnings, perhaps using some sort of counting to see how much tests
        still need to run.

## Plans

These are some plans I've dreamt up for `react-a11y`:

  - [x] **make rules pluggable like [eslint][eslint].**  It would be nice
    for everyone to be able to write their own rules and inject
    them into `react-a11y`.  First of all, this would mean less 
    maintenance for me, since poeple can build their own, and it 
    would make `react-a11y` a formidable validation tool.
  - [ ] **create a nice project page** with documentation, because
    that is what people like these days.
  - [ ] create filtering options based on rule outputs like `affects`
